# Smart Factory IoT Analytics on AWS

This is an end-to-end IoT data pipeline project that simulates a smart factory production line using AWS services. It ingests real-time sensor data, stores it in S3, processes and transforms it with Lambda and Athena, and visualizes it using Amazon QuickSight â€” all within (or near) AWS Free Tier limits.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal is to demonstrate a scalable, event-driven data pipeline on AWS using simulated IoT sensor data from a production environment. The project includes:

- Real-time data ingestion via MQTT using AWS IoT Core
- Data processing and routing via AWS Lambda
- Storage in Amazon S3 (raw and processed zones)
- Data cataloging with AWS Glue
- Querying using Amazon Athena
- Dashboards built in Amazon QuickSight
