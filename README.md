# Smart Factory IoT Analytics on AWS (Free Tier Edition)

This project simulates a smart factory production line using AWS services â€” optimized to stay within AWS Free Tier limits. It features real-time IoT data ingestion, serverless processing, cloud storage, and analytics dashboards.

---

## Overview

- **Data Ingestion**: Simulated sensor data sent via MQTT using the **AWS IoT Device SDK for Python**
- **Processing**: Real-time triggers with **AWS Lambda**
- **Storage**: Raw and processed data stored in **Amazon S3**
- **Cataloging**: Managed by **AWS Glue**
- **Querying**: Performed with **Amazon Athena**
- **Visualization**: Dashboards built in **Amazon QuickSight**
